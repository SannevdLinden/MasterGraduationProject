## Data is fake
All the .json files in the assets folder contain fake data to illustrate the interactions of the system. 

## Search function
To run the search function a license of UMLS is needed: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/umls.html, then the instructions of the PyMedTermino2 library (https://owlready2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymedtermino2.html) need to be followed to be able to run the code in the search folder. This takes a lot of time. You can see the working version of the search function in the video. Without this the search function does not work and only gives an error.
