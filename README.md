# MasterGraduationProject

This folder contains the GUI and the data analysis for the GUI of my master thesis research project. In order to run certain pieces of the code a UMLS ( https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/umls.html) and MIMIC-III (Johnson, A., Pollard, T., & Mark, R. (2016). MIMIC-III Clinical Database (version 1.4). PhysioNet. https://doi.org/10.13026/C2XW26) license are needed. You need to obtain these licenses for yourself in order to run the complete code. The GUI and data_analysis folders README files explain for which files these license are needed.

For a video of the working prototype see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jOJBtkJ5R4 (all visible data is fake and a black rectangle is placed over the synonyms retrieved from the UMLS CUI concepts while using the search function).
